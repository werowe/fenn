**Stop writing boilerplate. Start training.**

pySMLE is a lightweight Python framework that automates the "boring stuff" in Machine Learning projects. It handles configuration parsing, logging setup, and experiment tracking so you can focus on the model.

## Why pySMLE?

* **Auto-Configuration:** `yaml` files are automatically parsed and injected into your entrypoint. No more hardcoded hyperparameters.
* **Instant Logging:** All print statements and configs are automatically captured to local logs and remote trackers.
* **Remote Monitoring:** Native integration with [Weights & Biases (WandB)](https://wandb.ai/) to monitor experiments from anywhere.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pysmle
````

## Quickstart

### Initialize a Project

Run the CLI tool to generate a template and config file:

```bash
pysmle init
```

### Configuration

pySMLE relies on a simple YAML structure to define hyperparameters, paths, logging options, and integrations.
You can configure the ``smle.yaml`` file with the hyperparameters and options for your project.

The structure of the ``smle.yaml`` file is:

```yaml
# ---------------------------------------
# pySMLE Configuration (Modify Carefully)
# ---------------------------------------

project: project_name

# ---------------------------
# Logging & Tracking
# ---------------------------

logger:
  dir: logger

wandb:
  entity: your_wandb_account

# ---------------------------------------
# Example of User Section
# ---------------------------------------

seed: seed
device: 'cpu'/'cuda'

training:
    epochs: n_epochs
    lr: lr
    weight_decay: wd
    batch: batch_size

testing:
    batch: batch_size
```

**Note.**
pySMLE expects your Weights and Biases API key to be in the environment variable `WANDB_API_KEY`.
You can put it in the `.env` file, but ensure `.env` is in your `.gitignore`.

### Write Your Code

Use the `@app.entrypoint` decorator. Your configuration variables are automatically passed via `args`.

```python
from smle import pySMLE

app = SMLE()

@app.entrypoint
def main(args):
    # 'args' contains your pysmle.yaml configurations
    print(f"Training with learning rate: {args['training']['lr']}")

    # Your logic here...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

By default, pySMLE will look for a configuration file named `smle.yaml` in the current directory. If you would like to use a different name, a different location, or have multiple configuration files for different configurations, you can set the `config_file` property of pySMLE to the path of your file. You must assign the filename before calling `run()`.

```python
app = pySMLE()
app.config_file = "my_file.yaml"
...
app.run()
```

### Run It

```bash
python main.py
```
